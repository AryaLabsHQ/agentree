## Development Strategy

### Iterative Approach
1. **Start Simple**: Single process, basic UI
2. **Add Complexity**: Multiple processes, better UI
3. **Polish**: Performance, stability, features

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each component in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Full workflow scenarios
- **Manual Testing**: UI responsiveness, edge cases

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
1. **Terminal Emulation Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use existing library, adapt as needed
   - Fallback: Simplified output without full emulation

2. **Performance with Many Instances**
   - Mitigation: Lazy rendering, output buffering
   - Fallback: Instance limits, pagination

3. **Claude Code Integration**
   - Mitigation: Start with mock processes
   - Fallback: Generic process multiplexer

**Schedule Risks**:
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict phase boundaries
   - Fallback: Defer features to post-launch

2. **Technical Unknowns**
   - Mitigation: Early prototyping
   - Fallback: Simplify architecture

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Easier UI development
- Better for remote access
- **Time**: 6-8 weeks

### Option 3: Integration with Existing Tools
- Build on tmux/screen
- Less custom code
- Limited features
- **Time**: 2-3 weeks

## Conclusion

The multiplexer is an ambitious but achievable project. By breaking it into phases and maintaining flexibility, we can deliver value incrementally while building toward the full vision. The key is to start simple, validate assumptions early, and iterate based on real usage.
