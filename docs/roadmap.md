# agentree Roadmap ðŸŒ³ðŸ¤–

## Vision

agentree aims to be the definitive tool for managing isolated development environments optimized for AI coding agents. By treating each worktree as a complete, context-aware development environment, we enable developers to work seamlessly with multiple AI assistants on concurrent tasks without conflicts or context pollution.

## Core Value Proposition

While Git worktrees provide branch isolation, they lack critical features for modern AI-assisted development:
- Environment configuration (.env files) aren't copied
- No setup automation for dependencies
- Missing context management for AI agents
- No workflow optimization for agent handoffs

agentree bridges this gap by providing environment-aware worktree management specifically designed for AI coding workflows.

## Key Integration: Claude Code + GitHub Actions

A primary focus of agentree is enabling powerful automation workflows with Claude Code through GitHub Actions. This combination allows:

- **Automated Code Reviews**: Trigger Claude Code to review PRs with full project context
- **Test Generation**: Automatically generate tests for new features
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep docs in sync with code changes
- **Refactoring Tasks**: Schedule large-scale refactoring with proper isolation
- **Bug Fixes**: Auto-create worktrees for issue resolution

Example workflow:
```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]

jobs:
  auto-fix:
    if: contains(github.event.label.name, 'claude-fix')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: aryalabs/agentree-action@v1
        with:
          agent: claude
          task: fix-issue
          issue: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
```
