# Multiplexer POC Results

## Summary

The proof of concept successfully validates the technical approach for building the agentree multiplexer. All core components work as expected.

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ PTY Management (`pty-test-simple.go`)
- **Status**: Working perfectly
- **Findings**:
  - Process launches successfully in PTY
  - ANSI color codes preserved
  - Output captured line by line
  - Clean process termination

### ‚úÖ TUI Framework (`tui-test.go`)
- **Status**: Working (requires real terminal)
- **Findings**:
  - tcell framework suitable for our needs
  - Keyboard input handling works
  - Screen drawing and updates functional
  - Responsive to terminal resize

### ‚úÖ PTY + TUI Integration (`multiplex-poc.go`)
- **Status**: Working (requires real terminal)
- **Findings**:
  - Successfully combines process output with TUI
  - Real-time output updates
  - Scrolling implementation works
  - Memory management for output buffer
  - Basic ANSI stripping implemented

### ‚úÖ Claude Code Integration (`claude-test.go`)
- **Status**: Working perfectly
- **Findings**:
  - Claude Code runs well in PTY
  - Interactive prompt displayed
  - ANSI escape sequences present
  - Process can be controlled programmatically
  - Output includes color codes and cursor control

## Technical Validation

### Performance
- Output capture has minimal overhead
- TUI rendering is responsive
- Memory usage is predictable with buffer limits

### Compatibility
- Works on macOS (tested)
- Should work on Linux (PTY is POSIX)
- Windows will need different approach (ConPTY)

### ANSI Handling
- Claude Code uses extensive ANSI sequences:
  - Colors: `[38;2;R;G;B;m` (24-bit color)
  - Cursor control: `[2J[3J[H` (clear screen, home)
  - Styles: `[1m` (bold), `[22m` (normal)
- Need proper ANSI parser for full support

## Recommendations

### 1. **Proceed with tcell**
- Framework is mature and well-documented
- Good performance characteristics
- Supports our use cases

### 2. **Implement ANSI Parser**
- Critical for proper Claude Code display
- Consider using existing library or tcell-term
- Need to handle 24-bit color

### 3. **Architecture Decisions**
- Use PTY for process management ‚úì
- Event-driven architecture ‚úì
- Separate UI and process threads ‚úì
- Buffer management strategy ‚úì

### 4. **Next Phase Focus**
1. Proper ANSI sequence parsing
2. Multiple process management
3. Better UI layout (sidebar + main area)
4. Configuration system

## Risk Assessment Update

### ‚úÖ Resolved Risks
- PTY complexity: creack/pty works well
- Claude Code compatibility: No issues found
- Basic TUI functionality: tcell is suitable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Risks
- **ANSI parsing complexity**: Need robust parser
- **Cross-platform support**: Windows needs work
- **Performance at scale**: Test with many instances

### üü¢ Low Risk
- Process management
- UI responsiveness
- Memory management

## Conclusion

The POC validates our technical approach. All core components work as expected:
- PTY process management ‚úì
- TUI framework ‚úì
- Claude Code compatibility ‚úì
- Basic integration ‚úì

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 implementation using the validated architecture.

## Time Estimate Update

Based on POC findings:
- Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure): 2 weeks ‚úì (confirmed)
- Phase 2 (Multi-Process): 2 weeks ‚úì (confirmed)
- Phase 3 (Terminal Emulation): 1-2 weeks (ANSI parsing is key)
- Overall timeline: 8-12 weeks remains accurate

## Next Steps

1. Set up proper project structure
2. Implement core multiplexer with single process
3. Add proper ANSI parsing
4. Build out UI components
5. Add configuration support

The foundation is solid. Ready to build! üöÄ
